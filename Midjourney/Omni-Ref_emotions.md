Me when I see how good Midjourney Omni-Ref is with emotions!

I used the first image as the Oref and changed the prompt to 'she’s [crying]'

Not all the emotions are working well with her yet, but I’ll keep testing and share more soon.

I created the first image with Midjourney, then used Omni-Reference to generate the rest.
