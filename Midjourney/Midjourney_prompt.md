Base prompt :

Elven woman with alabaster skin and soft grey eyes framed by long, straight chestnut hair that flows like silk. Her sharp eyebrows and parted lips form an expression of serene allure, composed yet inviting. 
A fine silver circlet crowns her brow, paired with geometric earrings that glint with subtle elegance. Full-body, stylized concept shot in graphite pencil, fashion-illustration inspired. 
She wears a gossamer sheer drapery wrapped artfully around her hips, the fabric clinging and shifting to hint at the soft curvature beneath. Over one shoulder, a single pauldron of engraved silver armor curves like a sculpted ornament, balancing delicacy with strength. Her posture is graceful and self-possessed one hand gently resting on her thigh, the other lifting slightly as if beckoning or casting. 
The white studio backdrop is softly lit to highlight the form, surrounded by angled portrait studies and close-ups of her adornments, composing a high-fantasy artbook page with quiet sensuality and poise. --ar 9:16 --raw --v 7
