Hyper-detailed, ethereal vintage watercolor collage portrait of an elegant woman with brown hair styled in an updo and women with the same facial features as in the original image. 
She is wearing a delicate, ornate pearl and diamond crown, a vintage cream-colored lace gown with puff sleeves and intricate beading, and lustrous pearl drop earrings, along with a multi-strand pearl and jewel necklace. Her hands are clasped gently in front of her, adorned with rings. The background is a soft, warm-toned watercolor collage featuring blooming pastel flowers, 
botanical elements, and faint architectural sketches, creating a dreamy and timeless aesthetic.
