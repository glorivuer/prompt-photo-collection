A pencil drawing of [character or object] [breaking through / emerging from / interacting with] [a paper surface or cracked wall], in the style of a tattoo sketch on white paper. Black pen and pencil only, with [one specific element] in [a vivid color] as the only colored detail. Trompe-l’œil effect with [torn edges / curled paper / cracked wall], realistic shadowing, sketchbook illustration style, high detail.



The white skirt (chima) is softly gathered or flowing. A faint, sketch-like outline of the same woman, possibly in a simpler white Hanbok, positioned slightly behind and to the left of the main subject. This "ghost" image is less defined, almost like a pencil drawing or a faded memory. Her gaze is softer, looking dirctly from the viewer. The entire composition incorporates a "working sketch" aesthetic. This includes:Faint pencil lines and construction guides.
Handwritten notes or Korean text (hangul) in various sizes and densities, appearing as if jotted down on a piece of paper. These should be artistic elements rather than coherent readable text if possible, contributing to the "sketchbook" feel.Subtle paper textures – creases, faint stains, or the appearance of being drawn on an old document.Splashes or smudges of paint/ink, particularly around the Hanbok, enhancing the artistic, hand-rendered quality.
Red accents (e.g., a small seal mark or underline) within the text or as a subtle highlight.Soft, diffused light to enhance the ethereal quality of the background figure and the delicate textures of the Hanbok. A slight directional light could highlight the main subject's features.Dominated by blues, whites, and muted reds/browns, with touches of black for the hair and ink-like textual elements. The overall feel should be ophisticated yet slightly nostalgic.
A medium close-up shot of the main subject, angled slightly to her right.
