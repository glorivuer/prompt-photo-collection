Convert this image into a funny sketch cartoon effect with expressive ink-style outlines and exaggerated but recognizable faces. Use vivid digital colors, light shading, and subtle hatching for depth. Keep a clean white background with minimal motion lines for energy. The artwork should look lively, dynamic, and hand-drawn, turning the emotional moment into a playful caricature while keeping its essence. Maintain a vibrant, humorous, and cinematic tone.
