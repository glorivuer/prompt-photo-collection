    "prompt": "Cinematic ultra-realistic image of a dinosaur emerging through dense tropical jungle foliage. Early morning sunlight breaks through the tall canopy, forming golden shafts of light that illuminate dust and mist in the air. The dinosaur — a majestic Tyrannosaurus rex — stands partially hidden among giant ferns and vines, its textured skin glistening slightly with moisture. The scene feels humid, alive, and full of depth. Light leaks through layers of green leaves, scattering soft rays across foggy air. The tone is epic yet natural, like a movie still from a high-end adventure film.",
