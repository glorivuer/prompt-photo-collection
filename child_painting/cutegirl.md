Hair: Long, dark brown hair with straight bangs, styled into a single side braid adorned with a small orange flower hair clip.
Clothing: She is wearing a loose-fitting, vibrant orange crew-neck sweater/sweatshirt. On the sleeve, there's a delicate orange butterfly embellishment. Paired with light olive green/khaki shorts.
Accessories: An orange beret on her head, and a small, structured beige/light olive green square crossbody bag with a metallic clasp.
Pose: A mid-shot of the girl, slightly leaning to her left. Her right index finger is playfully touching her right cheek. Her left arm hangs naturally. Her eyes are gently closed, and her lips are softly puckered.
Background: A solid, soft olive green color background. Three orange butterflies of varying sizes are flying gracefully on the right side of the frame, adding a whimsical and lively touch.
Style: High-quality 3D render, cartoon illustration style with soft lighting, smooth lines, vivid but gentle colors, detailed textures, and a clean aesthetic. The overall mood is warm, innocent, cheerful, and charming.
Composition: Mid-shot, with the girl slightly off-center to the left, balanced by the butterflies on the right. Shallow depth of field to emphasize the character.
