  "subject": {
    "description": "A cheerful Japanese female reporter in her early 20s, with sun-kissed skin and animated facial expressions. She has bright eyes, full lips, and long dark brown hair partially swept by volcanic winds. She wears playful gold star-shaped earrings and smiles with infectious energy.",
    "wardrobe": "She wears a red lace camisole-style top, contrasting with the rugged volcanic landscape. Her outfit is light and summery, ironically ill-suited for the scorching environment. Her nails are painted with glittery magma-inspired red."

  "scene": {
    "location": "the rim of an active volcano crater in Japan",
    "time_of_day": "midday",
    "environment": "jagged volcanic rocks surround the glowing crater filled with bubbling lava. Heat distortion rises from the surface, and strong gusts of wind blow ash and hair around. Occasional rumbling from deep below adds intensity to the scene."
  },
  "visual_details": {
    "action": "The reporter holds up a glowing, lava-like food chunk with exaggerated excitement. She grins and takes a theatrical bite, chews slowly, then leans toward the mic and shouts with a smirk: 'Umee!! ...Kinnkinn ni hiete yagaru!' in a dramatic ASMR whisper.",
    "props": "fictional glowing magma snack resembling volcanic rock, portable collar mic, wind-blown hair, visible crater smoke in the background"

  "audio": {
    "ambient": "howling volcanic wind, distant seismic rumbles, bubbling lava sounds, crackling air, ASMR chewing exaggerated for comedic effect",
    "vocal": "Japanese with heightened energy: loud ‘Umee!!’ followed by a sudden drop to whisper-level ‘Kinnkinn ni hiete yagaru…’"
  },
