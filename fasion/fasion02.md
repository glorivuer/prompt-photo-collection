Another example using Runwayâ€™s new References update. I used Ref 1 and Ref 2 to dress her up, and it turned out pretty cool imo. https://x.com/egeberkina/status/1922363408751505834

Since Iâ€™m not great at drawing, I went with a sketch-style image generated with Midjourneyâ€”but if you can draw, you can totally use your own illustration instead!

Iâ€™ve dropped the prompt in the ALT text, and youâ€™ll also need a blank canvas image for the first transition.

ow we head over to 
@higgsfield_ai
 and use the Time Lapse Human effect, setting the first frame as the blank canvas and the final frame as the sketch.

Bring it to life using the prompt youâ€™ve got in the imageâ€™s ALT text.

Nice! Time to animate the sketch. Pick the snorricam motion to track her walk, use the sketch as your base, and the ALT prompt.

Then pull the last frame of the clip, cut it in half, and grab that middle frame too.

Now we take that final frame over to 
@Magnific_AI
. Weâ€™re gonna use Structure Reference to turn the image into a real photo.

The promptâ€™s in the ALTâ€”itâ€™s seriously amazing!


Now weâ€™re back to Higgsâ€”this time using the middle frame we pulled earlier as the starting point and the Magnific-enhanced frame as the end.

Keep Snorricam as the motion control and use the ALT prompt again. Perfect transition!

But letâ€™s add a little twistâ€”what if we want the main character to change locations? Easy. Weâ€™ll use References in Runway. Just ask it to generate the same person in different scenes.

The prompt is in the ALT, plus thereâ€™s a sample screenshot for reference.

And weâ€™re back to Higgs! Use Snorricam again, set the previous final frame as the starting point, and the new one from References as the end. The promptâ€™s in the ALT as alwaysâ€¦

What do you think?
