Tried combining MidJourney and ChatGPT for a packaging concept — MJ for the visuals, GPT for front & back layout, copy, and even a barcode.
Honestly, a really solid combo for design work.

The promt I used for Chat GPT:
"Create an photo image of this packaging from front and the back standing next to each other. KEEP it strictly frontal, no perspective, just frontal angle.
1) Front side – exactly like the first photo: same colors, illustration, and white text box. Keep everything 1:1.
2) Create Back side – standard herbal tea info: a short story or brand legend, brewing instructions, ingredients, technical info, small icons, and a barcode. Keep the layout minimal and clean, in the same style as the front. andd some beautiful clean illustrations about how to prepare herbaltea. All the text should be in Spanish.
keep the style of packaging mockup"
