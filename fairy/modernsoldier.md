Ultra-realistic cinematic military scene featuring the uploaded person as a modern soldier.  The person is wearing full desert-tan combat gear, including a ballistic helmet, goggles, tactical vest with pouches, gloves, knee pads, and sand-covered boots. They hold a black assault rifle across the chest with both hands. Their uniform has a rugged, worn look with dust on the fabric and gear.

Next to them stands another soldier in similar desert camouflage, holding binoculars at eye level. Both soldiers appear focused and alert.

Set in a dry desert environment during a sandstorm, with fine dust blowing in the air. The ground is pale, textured desert sand with visible footprints and tire marks. Behind the soldiers is a large armored military vehicle in matching desert-tan color, partially blurred by dust. Metal surfaces on the vehicle show light reflections and sand buildup.

Warm, muted brown-orange color tone across the entire scene, giving a hazy late-afternoon look. Soft directional light from above, creating natural shadows under helmets, gear, and legs. Subtle heat-haze effect around the background vehicle. Depth of field keeps both soldiers sharp while the vehicle and far background fade gently into blur.

Camera angle is eye level, framing the soldiers from head to toe. Composition places one soldier slightly behind the other, creating depth. Mood is tense, calm, and professional, like a real military operation photo taken during patrol. High detail on textures, dust particles, clothing folds, weapon surfaces, and lighting transitions.

Make sure the uploaded face blends naturally with the lighting, dust tone, shadows, and atmosphere of the scene.
