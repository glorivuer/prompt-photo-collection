A 5-year-old child, smiling, peers curiously from behind a dark blue, half-open door. Surrounding her, also peering out, are the characters Mario (with his red cap and mustache), Doraemon (the blue robot cat with the bell), Tom (the gray cat with green eyes and a wary expression), Jerry (the smiling brown mouse with his arms outstretched), Longlegs (a gray rabbit with a carrot in his hand), Taz Mania (the Tasmanian devil with his windmill from the waist down), Sylvester (a mischievous black cat), and Tweety (the large-headed yellow canary). All clearly visible.
The child should be the focal point, with the characters slightly behind or around her, all with expressions of curiosity and surprise, as if they were spying on something together. The lighting is dramatic and cinematic, coming from one side, creating soft, realistic shadows. The cartoon characters' images must be rendered in a photorealistic 3D style, with extremely detailed textures in the fur, clothing, skin, and wood of the door, without visual aberrations or blurry elements. The depth of field must be clear on all characters and the child, with a slight blur in the dark background to highlight the foreground. No aspect ratio errors or digital artifacts. Professional studio quality.
