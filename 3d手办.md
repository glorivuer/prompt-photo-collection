turn this photo into a character figure. Behind it, place a box with the characterâ€™s image printed on it, and a computer showing the Blender modeling process on its screen. In front of the box, add a round plastic base with the character figure standing on it. Make the PVC material look clear, and set the scene indoors if possible.
