We've released an update to Gen-4 References that brings marked improvements to aesthetic quality, scene composition and identity preservation. Alongside this update comes a number of exciting new use cases which we'll be sharing more about in the coming days.

Gen-4 References is available to all Runway plans.

您现在可以指定布局！通过准备粗略的构图，您可以通过控制物体的位置和放置来生成图像。我尝试了一下并且它按照指示工作了。对 Runway 参考资料抱有很高的期望

This update brings a completely new set of creative capabilities and improvements to References. An interesting emergent property is the ability of the model to precisely place objects in your scene using a layout you can provide. 

If you find new use cases, please share them.
