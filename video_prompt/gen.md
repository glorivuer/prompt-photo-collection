The camera slowly arcs around the levitating product-object, a simple glass candle jar with a burning flame, suspended mid-air above a balanced stack of smooth stones. Surrounding it, 
smaller oval stones float in perfect circular harmony, reinforcing the sense of meditative stillness. At the base, a miniature monk sits calmly in lotus position, eyes closed in deep meditation, undisturbed by the mystical levitation. 
The arc movement gracefully reveals every detail on the candle jar, remaining fixed and statically pinned regardless of the cameraâ€™s perspective.
