Transform the subjects or image into an adorable chibi-style character with a tiny body and an oversized head. If the image contains a person or multiple people, give them large, sparkling eyes, soft rounded facial features, and a cheerful expression while preserving their recognizable traits such as key facial features, hairstyle, accessories, or distinctive clothing; if the image contains an object, animal, or scene, reinterpret its most recognizable features using the same chibi proportions and simplified, cute styling. Keep the overall look short and cute, with smooth pastel shading and simplified details. Make the final image bright, expressive, and irresistibly charming, like a collectible chibi mascot.


100% created from attached face. Realistic photo of a young woman (not a childlike face) with a tiny head. 
She is washing her face and brushing her teeth in the morning in a sink that is too big for her. She is standing on a tube of toothpaste,
like a shoe stand. One hand holds a toothbrush the size of her own. She is struggling to brush her teeth. Water splashes all over her face and hair,
which is a little messy. Her face makes a funny surprised expression, like water splashed into her eyes. She is wearing a loose t-shirt and cute cartoon shorts.
Her hair is tied in a high bun or with small, brightly colored clips.
The background is a clean, white bathroom. There is morning sunlight shining in gently through the window.
