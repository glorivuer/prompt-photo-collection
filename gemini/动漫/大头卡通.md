100% created from attached face. Realistic photo of a young woman (not a childlike face) with a tiny head. 
She is washing her face and brushing her teeth in the morning in a sink that is too big for her. She is standing on a tube of toothpaste,
like a shoe stand. One hand holds a toothbrush the size of her own. She is struggling to brush her teeth. Water splashes all over her face and hair,
which is a little messy. Her face makes a funny surprised expression, like water splashed into her eyes. She is wearing a loose t-shirt and cute cartoon shorts.
Her hair is tied in a high bun or with small, brightly colored clips.
The background is a clean, white bathroom. There is morning sunlight shining in gently through the window.
