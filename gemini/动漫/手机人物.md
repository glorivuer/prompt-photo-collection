A dramatic digital art image, surreal concept, of me use the uploaded photo[image1 ,with 100% facial accuracy, with fair skin, delicate features, 
and long dark brown hair], wearing a light gold silk slip dress, emerging from a smartphone screen.
Iâ€™m holding a Ceramic teapot and pouring hot, dark coffee into a white porcelain coffee cup resting on a saucer.
The Coffee pouring from a teapot , creating a surreal 3D effect. The scene is set on a dark, rustic wooden table with scattered coffee beans around the cup. 
A large hand holds the Google pixel smartphone, which seems to float in a dark, smoky gray studio background. The lighting is dramatic and studio-quality, 
highlighting the texture of the coffee and my face. Ultra-realistic, high detail, volumetric lighting, photorealistic.
