Ultra-realistic UHD 4K cinematic photograph of a person (based on the uploaded photo) taking a full-body selfie mid-air beside Doraemon and Nobita, both flying using baling-baling bambu (bamboo propellers) on their heads.

The person is smiling naturally, holding a smartphone in one hand while flying effortlessly. Their modern blue-and-white casual outfit flutters slightly in the wind, with soft, realistic fabric motion. 
They are wearing long blue pants that move naturally in the breeze, matching the outfitâ€™s overall color harmony.

Nobita appears right beside the person, rendered in authentic 3D cartoon style with vivid colors and smooth Pixar-like shading. He wears his iconic yellow shirt with a white collar and blue shorts, along with white socks and simple sneakers. His black hair is neat, his round glasses shine gently under sunlight, lanjut and his cheerful, innocent expression perfectly captures his original personality. His skin has a soft, animated texture that contrasts naturally with the photorealistic human subject.

Doraemon hovers close on the other side, smiling warmly, with detailed soft blue fur, a glossy metallic bell reflecting sunlight, and natural shading that blends perfectly with the environment. lanjut
