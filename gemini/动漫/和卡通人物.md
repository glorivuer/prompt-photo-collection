Create a full-body studio photoshoot portrait of a handsome young man (same subject as previous prompts) posing beside Tanjiro Kamado from Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, captured in an elegant yet cinematic fashion studio setting.

Tanjiro Kamado is accurately depicted with his signature dark maroon hair fading into fiery red tips, scar above his right eyebrow, and gentle, determined eyes that radiate compassion and strength. He wears his iconic green-and-black checkered haori over a dark brown Demon Slayer uniform, a Nichirin sword sheathed at his side, and traditional zōri sandals.

The pose captures a grounded yet powerful stillness — Tanjiro stands slightly angled, one knee bent forward, both hands resting gently on the sword’s hilt as if at peace after a battle. The young man sits on the studio floor just beside him, one arm resting casually over his bent knee, head tilted slightly upward, looking at Tanjiro with quiet admiration.

The studio background is a clean minimalist gradient — smoky teal blending into muted gray, evoking mist after rain. Subtle air effects hint at motion, with faint trails suggesting the swirl of water breathing around Tanjiro’s form.

Lighting is soft directional, coming from above and slightly behind, emphasizing fabric textures and the sheen of the sword. Gentle reflections on the floor create visual balance and depth.

The camera angle is slightly low and off-center, giving a cinematic intimacy — as though capturing a moment between calm and courage.

Rendered in 8K ultra detail, cinematic soft lighting, realistic fabric and texture rendering, inspired by Japanese high-fashion minimalism and editorial anime-realism crossovers.
A serene power portrait — where resolve meets grace, and stillness holds strength.

Ultra-realistic UHD 4K cinematic photograph of a person (based on the uploaded photo) taking a full-body selfie mid-air beside Doraemon and Nobita, both flying using baling-baling bambu (bamboo propellers) on their heads.

The person is smiling naturally, holding a smartphone in one hand while flying effortlessly. Their modern blue-and-white casual outfit flutters slightly in the wind, with soft, realistic fabric motion. 
They are wearing long blue pants that move naturally in the breeze, matching the outfit’s overall color harmony.

Nobita appears right beside the person, rendered in authentic 3D cartoon style with vivid colors and smooth Pixar-like shading. He wears his iconic yellow shirt with a white collar and blue shorts, along with white socks and simple sneakers. His black hair is neat, his round glasses shine gently under sunlight, lanjut and his cheerful, innocent expression perfectly captures his original personality. His skin has a soft, animated texture that contrasts naturally with the photorealistic human subject.

Doraemon hovers close on the other side, smiling warmly, with detailed soft blue fur, a glossy metallic bell reflecting sunlight, and natural shading that blends perfectly with the environment. lanjut
