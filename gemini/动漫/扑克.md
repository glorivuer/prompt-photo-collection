assertive expression, seated at a perfectly reflective glass table that mirrors his upper body seamlessly. Straight-on chest-level camera framing,

A subtle rectangular glow of soft luminous light surrounds the scene, crisp at the edges and gently diffused inward, forming a realistic card-style border. 
Bright white studio backdrop with faint warm undertones. Reflection matches brightness and tone, mirrored perfectly below. 
Large “K ♣” symbols in the top-left and bottom-right corners. 
Elegant, cinematic, minimalist realism. 3:2 vertical aspect ratio, ultra-detailed, clean tones, premium studio finish.
