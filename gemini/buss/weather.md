Light snow turning into heavy snow across the Halifax with intense wind.

Tried it out on my hometown. As WEATHER_EFFECT: hoarfrost and fog.

Prompt: Photorealistic miniature city model presented as a sculpted city block on a clean white background.
The city represents {CITY_NAME}, featuring simplified but recognizable iconic architecture, arranged in a compact, elevated layout.
At the very top of the image, display the city name {CITY_NAME} in elegant, minimal typography.
Directly beneath it, display the temperature {TEMPERATURE}°C in smaller, subtle text.

Epic weather elements interact directly with the city:
– {WEATHER_EFFECT} appears over and around the buildings
– Clouds, sunlight, rain, snow, or fog partially envelop the skyline
– Weather feels larger than the city, monumental yet calm
Soft global illumination, realistic materials, cinematic atmosphere.
Minimal, premium, editorial-style composition.
Pure white background, no clutter, no UI elements.
Ultra-high realism, calm and iconic presentation.
