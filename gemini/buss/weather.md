Ultra-realistic cinematic studio portrait of a woman directing a miniature film set starring a tiny lifelike version of herself.
She adjusts a miniature camera while the small figure stands under scaled studio lights.
The miniature self matches her exact appearance, outfit, and natural expression.
The environment includes mini tripods, clapperboards, light modifiers, and film reels.
Moody cinematic lighting enhances realism, skin texture, and micro-set detail.
Shallow depth of field, cinematic framing, ultra-photorealistic textures, 8K detail.
Style: cinematic studio realism, no illustration, no CGI. 1:1

Light snow turning into heavy snow across the Halifax with intense wind.

Tried it out on my hometown. As WEATHER_EFFECT: hoarfrost and fog.

Prompt: Photorealistic miniature city model presented as a sculpted city block on a clean white background.
The city represents {CITY_NAME}, featuring simplified but recognizable iconic architecture, arranged in a compact, elevated layout.
At the very top of the image, display the city name {CITY_NAME} in elegant, minimal typography.
Directly beneath it, display the temperature {TEMPERATURE}°C in smaller, subtle text.

Epic weather elements interact directly with the city:
– {WEATHER_EFFECT} appears over and around the buildings
– Clouds, sunlight, rain, snow, or fog partially envelop the skyline
– Weather feels larger than the city, monumental yet calm
Soft global illumination, realistic materials, cinematic atmosphere.
Minimal, premium, editorial-style composition.
Pure white background, no clutter, no UI elements.
Ultra-high realism, calm and iconic presentation.
