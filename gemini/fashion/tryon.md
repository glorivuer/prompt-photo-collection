An ultra-detailed street style photograph of a chic 23-year-old female fashion editor[image1 ,face 100% match, with fair skin, delicate features, and a gentle, serene expression] walking confidently down a street in the Le Marais district, Paris. It's golden hour, with warm, cinematic sunlight.

She is wearing[image2 ] an open beige cropped trench coat, a sleeveless burgundy knit top with gold buttons, high-waisted cream wide-leg trousers with a thin brown belt. On her feet are retro burgundy suede sneakers with white stripes. She carries a structured taupe pebbled leather tote bag. 

The shot is a dynamic full-body capture, eye-level, using the rule of thirds. Shallow depth of field with the background beautifully blurred. Photorealistic, captured on a Sony a7 IV with an 85mm f/1.4 lens, 8K, high resolution.
