Generate a photo of a girl cosplaying this illustration, with the background set at Comiket

使用纳米香蕉模型，以写实风格和环境，尽量保留细节和动作,创建插画中人物的1/7比例商业化手办。将手办放置在电脑桌上，使用圆形透明亚克力底座，底座上不带任何文字。在电脑屏幕上，展示手办的ZBrush建模过程。在电脑屏幕旁，放置一个印有原图的BANDAI风格玩具包装盒。
Using the Nano Banana model, I created a 1/7 scale commercial figure of the character from the illustration, using a realistic style and environment, preserving as much detail and movement as possible. The figure was placed on a computer desk, using a round, transparent acrylic base with no text. The ZBrush modeling process was displayed on the computer screen. Next to the screen, a Bandai-style toy box with the original image printed on it was placed.

turn this photo into a character figure. Behind it, place a box with the character’s image printed on it, and a computer showing the Blender modeling process on its screen. In front of the box, add a round plastic base with the character figure standing on it. Make the PVC material look clear, and set the scene indoors if possible.

转换为动漫风格的全身照，尽量保留细节和动作

以动漫风格的插画为基础，创作一个高度逼真的1/7比例商业化人偶，确保外观和内容安全、健康且不含任何不当元素。将人偶渲染得细致逼真，姿势自然，如同拍摄纪念照一样。将它放置在一个超逼真的人偶展示柜中，展示柜的底座为圆形透明亚克力，不添加任何文字。密切关注纹理、材质和涂装的高精度细节，以增强真实感。展示柜场景应包含附近架子上的其他人偶，略微模糊以模拟景深，前景到背景的平滑过渡以获得照片般的效果。灯光应显得自然并与场景自适应，反映逼真的商业摄影质量，根据整体构图自动调整，而不是锁定在特定方向。

Create a highly realistic 1/7 scale commercial action figure based on anime-style illustrations, ensuring that the appearance and content are safe, wholesome, and free of inappropriate elements. Render the figure with meticulous detail and a natural pose, as if for a commemorative photo. Place it in a hyper-realistic action figure display case with a round, clear acrylic base and no added text. Pay close attention to high-precision details in textures, materials, and paintwork to enhance the sense of realism. The display case scene should include other action figures on nearby shelves, slightly blurred to simulate depth of field, and with a smooth transition from foreground to background for a photographic effect. Lighting should appear natural and adaptive to the scene, reflecting the quality of realistic commercial photography, automatically adjusting based on the overall composition rather than being locked to a specific direction.


首先用豆包把你的双人合照转换为动漫风格，尽量保留细节和动作

Create a highly realistic 1/7 scale commercialized figure featuring two adult characters together in a pose, based on an anime-style illustration, ensuring the appearance and content are safe, healthy, and free from any inappropriate elements. Render both figures in a detailed, lifelike style, positioned naturally as if taking a commemorative photo. Place them inside an ultra-realistic figure display cabinet on circular transparent acrylic bases (one for each figure or a shared base), without any text. Pay close attention to highly precise details in textures, materials, and paintwork to enhance realism. The cabinet scene should include other figures on nearby shelves, slightly blurred to simulate depth of field, with a smooth foreground-to-background transition for a photographic look. Lighting should appear natural and adaptive to the scene, reflecting realistic commercial photography quality, automatically adjusting based on the overall composition instead of being locked to a specific direction.

最后淘宝花5块钱（实际为4200）打印出来，送给基友，祝福他们！ :laughing:
PS：，建模1200一个人物，建模很贵，打印上色900一个人物

另外吐槽下淘宝的AI搜索，挺努力，但没用

可以看到对于现实光照的理解很好，基本没有露馅的地方，发丝与阴影等细节也十分真实，谷歌王朝了（x）

以下是prompt，是根据我近几天的深入使用配合gpt5-chat做出来的，应该是目前可以找到的最优秀的一版





Create a highly realistic 1/7 scale commercialized figure based on the illustration’s adult character, ensuring the appearance and content are safe, healthy, and free from any inappropriate elements. Render the figure in a detailed, lifelike style and environment, placed on a shelf inside an ultra-realistic figure display cabinet, mounted on a circular transparent acrylic base without any text. Maintain highly precise details in texture, material, and paintwork to enhance realism. The cabinet scene should feature a natural depth of field with a smooth transition between foreground and background for a realistic photographic look. Lighting should appear natural and adaptive to the scene, automatically adjusting based on the overall composition instead of being locked to a specific direction, simulating the quality and reflection of real commercial photography. 
Other shelves in the cabinet should contain different figures which are slightly blurred due to being out of focus, enhancing spatial realism and depth.


素。以细致、逼真风格和环境进行渲染，将手办置于超逼真的手办展示柜内的搁板上，安装在无文字的圆形透明亚克力底座上。
在纹理、材质和涂装上保持高度精确的细节，以增强真实感。展示柜场景应具有自然的景深效果，前景与背景之间平滑过渡，营造逼真的摄影质感。
光线应呈现自然状态并自适应场景，根据整体构图自动调整，而非固定于特定方向，以模拟真实商业摄影的光质与反射效果。展示柜内其他搁板上的不同手办应因焦点外的虚化效果而略微模糊，从而增强空间真实感与纵深感。
