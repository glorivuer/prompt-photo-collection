"Please retouch this portrait of the woman.
Hair Retouching: Remove all fine, stray hairs from her face, forehead, neck, and collarbone area. Make the hairline look clean and neat.
Lighting and Skin: Increase the overall brightness of the photo with soft light. 
Whiten her skin tone, remove dullness and unevenness, making it look fair, radiant, and glowing, but preserve the natural skin texture.
Facial Features Refinement: Refine her facial features. Make her eyes appear slightly larger and more sparkling. 
Subtly reshape the nose to be more delicate and defined. Smooth her facial contours for a softer and more graceful jawline."

Hairstyle Refinement: Without changing the original hairstyle, please refine it. Remove all flyaway, stray, and messy hairs, especially around her face, neck, and shoulders. The final hairstyle should look extremely neat, polished, and perfectly coiffed, as if professionally styled.
