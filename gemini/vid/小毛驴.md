特写镜头: 小女孩启动摩托车，摩托车发出轰鸣声, 小女孩用中文开心的唱道:"我有一头小毛驴，整天也不骑".
同时加大油门，前轮跃起，冲出画面.
画面逐渐拉远，远处传来女孩格格的笑声。

Close-up: A little girl starts her motorcycle, letting out a roar. She happily sings in Chinese, "I have a little donkey, and I never ride it all day."
Simultaneously, she steps on the accelerator, causing the front wheel to leap up and dash out of the frame.
The scene gradually zooms out, and the girl's giggles can be heard in the distance.
