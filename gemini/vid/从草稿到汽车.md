Prompt :

A white tiger steps through the snow-covered forest, each paw landing silently on the frozen ground. Frost clings to its whiskers as it moves beneath bare trees, its breath visible in the cold air. The stillness breaks only as it pauses, ears twitching toward a distant sound, eyes gleaming like ice.

"An 8-second, hyper-realistic sequence illustrating a vintage steam locomotive transitioning from a 2D technical blueprint into a fully realized, three-dimensional, functioning machine.", "duration_seconds": 8, "prompt_details": { "scene_timeline": { "seconds_0_to_3": { "phase": "The Schematic", "description": "The scene opens on a macro shot, panning slowly across the detailed ink lines of a locomotive blueprint on aged, yellowed parchment. The paper has frayed edges and folds. We hear the subtle, dry rustle of old paper and the distant, faint scratching of a draftsman's pen. The camera focuses on the intricate details of the wheels and pistons." }, "seconds_3_to_5": { "phase": "The Ghostly Assembly", "description": "The 2D lines of the blueprint begin to glow with a soft, warm light. They lift off the page, forming a three-dimensional wireframe model that hovers just above the paper. Ethereal, semi-transparent components begin to materialize within the wireframe. The sound shifts to include faint, metallic clicks and ethereal hums, as if a ghost is assembling the machine." }, "seconds_5_to_8": { "phase": "Full Steam Ahead", "description": "The ghostly components rapidly solidify into hyper-realistic materials—heavy, riveted steel, polished brass, and dark wood. The blueprint paper beneath dissolves into dust. The now-solid locomotive settles onto a realistic set of railway tracks in an old, sunlit railyard. A plume of thick, white steam erupts from the smokestack with a powerful hiss, the wheels lurch, and the massive train begins to chuff forward as the scene ends." } }, "subject": { "main_character": "A classic 19th-century steam locomotive.", "appearance": "Transitions from precise, black ink lines to a fully textured 3D model. The final model is made of weathered black steel with brass fittings that catch the light. It looks powerful and heavy. Soot stains and minor rust add to its realism.", "action": "The locomotive undergoes a magical construction, from a concept on paper to a living, breathing machine that starts to move under its own power." }, "environment": { "setting": "The scene transitions from a flat, two-dimensional blueprint surface to a three-dimensional, dusty, and sun-drenched industrial railyard.", "details": "The initial blueprint is filled with technical annotations and sketches. The final railyard has realistic details: gravel ballast between the wooden ties, weeds growing alongside the tracks, and a hazy, sunlit sky in the background." }, "camera_and_lighting": { "shot_type": "A single, continuous shot that starts as a close-up pan and slowly pulls back to a medium shot to capture the entire transformation and the final movement of the train.", "camera": "Virtual 8K cinematic camera, starting with a shallow depth of field on the paper and transitioning to a deeper focus to showcase the full, realistic train.", "lighting": "The lighting evolves from a single, warm overhead lamp illuminating the blueprint to bright, natural, late-afternoon sunlight in the railyard scene. The final lighting should create strong highlights and deep shadows on the complex machinery of the locomotive.", "focus": "The focus follows the action, starting on the ink lines, shifting to the forming 3D model, and finally resting on the fully assembled, moving train.", "color_palette": "Begins with monochromatic tones of sepia, parchment, and black ink. Transitions to a full-color, realistic palette with the deep blacks of the engine, the warm browns of the tracks, and the golden hues of the sunlight." }, "style": { "aesthetic": "A blend of historical documentary and magical realism. The sequence should feel grounded and technically precise, making the magical transition all the more wondrous and impactful.", "rendering_engine": "Unreal Engine 5 or equivalent, using PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials for the locomotive's surfaces, Lumen for the realistic lighting transition, and Niagara for the dynamic steam and smoke particle effects." } } }

Several graphite and colored pencils, an eraser, and a compass are scattered around the main drawing. The background is a dark, out-of-focus workshop." }, "lighting": { "primary_source": { "type": "Architect's Desk Lamp", "position": "Just out of frame, to the top left.", "fill_light": { "type": "Soft Ambient Light", "source": "From the out-of-focus workshop background.", "color": "Cool, bluish tint.", "intensity": "Low, to gently lift the darkest shadows and add depth to the scene." } }, "main_subject": { "name": "The Formula 1 Car", "initial_state": "A masterful, hyper-realistic pencil drawing. The lines are precise, the shading is smooth, and there's a sense of depth even in 2D.", "final_state": "A fully realized, photorealistic 3D model of the Red Bull F1 car. The materials are perfect: glossy carbon fiber, metallic paint with livery, and soft-sheen rubber tires.", "animation": { "0.0s - 2.0s": "The camera is focused on the drawing. A photorealistic hand enters the frame with an eraser and gently removes a few faint construction lines from the sketch.", "2.0s - 7.0s": "A magical 'wave' of transformation begins at the front wing of the car and sweeps backward. As it passes, the 2D pencil lines and shading seamlessly transform into 3D, textured materials. The drawn debris on the track lifts up and becomes real, floating for a moment before settling.", "7.0s - 8.0s": "The transformation is complete. The car is now fully 3D, sitting on the paper as if it's a real, miniature vehicle. The engine subtly whirs to life, and the exhaust vents emit a tiny, realistic heat haze." } }, 
"audio_design": { "style": "Transformative, from quiet and organic to powerful and cinematic.", "timeline": [ { "time": "0.0s - 2.0s", "sound": "The soft, realistic sound of a pencil's graphite scratching on paper, and the gentle 'shhh' of an eraser." }, { "time": "2.0s - 7.0s", "sound": "A low, magical humming and shimmering sound that grows in intensity and pitch as the transformation wave moves across the car. This is layered with an epic, swelling orchestral score." }, { "time": "7.0s - 8.0s", "sound": "The orchestral score reaches a crescendo. A final, satisfying 'click' as the transformation completes, followed by the low, powerful hum and subtle electronic whir of the F1 car's idling engine." } ] },
