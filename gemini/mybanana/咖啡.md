Create latte art using the original image.
If the original image is a person, use only the head as a reference.
Whether the original image is anime-style or realistic, simplify it to a certain extent before turning it into latte art. When doing so, be sure to remove all color information from the original image. Simplify and abstract appropriately. Discard the color information of the original image.
Use only milk in the latte art.
Make the table and macchiato photorealistic.
Serve a small cup of milk next to the macchiato.
The latte art is clearly visible from a top-down perspective.
When drawing a person, make sure to draw the eyes, nose, and mouth properly. Do not change the expression on your own.
