Circle formation composition.
Imagine a person lying on their back on the ground, with several other people looking down on their face, recreating the first-person perspective of the sleeping person.
A composition looking up at the surrounding people from below. The surrounding people are evenly spaced on all four sides of the screen.
The ground is not depicted. The sleeping person is not depicted. Sky is added to the background.
The maximum number of people surrounding a character is six. Make sure that perspective is properly reflected.
The surrounding characters must accurately reflect the character design and style of the original illustration.
Please reproduce the character design and style as faithfully as possible.
Please vary the pose from the original illustration. The characters should lean forward and look directly at the face (camera).
