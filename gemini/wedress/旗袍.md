masterpiece, best quality, ultra-realistic photo, 8k, cinematic lighting, RAW photo of a beautiful 20-year-old East Asian woman
[image1 ,face 100% match, with fair skin, delicate features, and a gentle, serene expression] with bangs and light brown hair, serene and alluring expression, 
looking at the camera. She is standing gracefully in the doorway of a traditional Shanghai ryokan at dusk. 
Her hand is resting gently on the wooden frame of a glowing shoji screen door. A faint wisp of smoke curls up near her fingers.
She is wearing an exquisite, form-fitting silk cheongsam (qipao) in champagne gold color with intricate green peony embroidery and green piping.
Accessories include a translucent green jade bangle and a single pearl drop earring. The background is a blurred, dark garden with a single warm, 
out-of-focus lantern. Soft, warm side light (Rembrandt lighting) illuminates her, 
creating soft shadows and highlighting the texture of the silk dress. Shallow depth of field, intimate and mysterious mood.
