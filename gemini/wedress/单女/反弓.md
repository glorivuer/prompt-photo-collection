Generate a full-body shot of a young bride[image1,with 100% facial accuracy, with fair skin, delicate features and dark long brown hair] in a flowing, light-colored wedding dress, captured in a serene outdoor setting. The bride's head is tilted gently to her right (approximately 5-10 degrees), with her face turned towards the right (about a 45-degree angle from the viewer). Her chin is slightly lifted, and her eyes are closed or looking softly upwards, conveying a feeling of peaceful enjoyment and reverie.
Her upper body is subtly angled, with a graceful, soft back arch originating from the waist, extending upwards and slightly to the right-rear, forming a gentle C-shaped curve along her spine. Her torso is delicately twisted to the right, causing her left shoulder to be slightly forward and her right shoulder to open backward. This combination of soft back arch and gentle twist creates an elegant S-curve throughout her upper body. Her left shoulder is subtly higher than her right, enhancing this fluid line.
Her right arm hangs naturally by her side, with a slight bend at the elbow, maintaining a natural distance from her body. Her right hand is in a relaxed, softly extended gesture: the palm faces inwards towards her body, while the back of the hand is gently visible. Her fingers are naturally aligned and softly curved, not splayed or tightly clenched. The index and middle fingers, in particular, show a gentle, flowing extension downwards, conveying effortlessness and grace. Her thumb rests subtly along the side of her palm. Her left arm is also relaxed, with her hand lightly touching or near the flowing fabric of her dress.
The voluminous skirt of her wedding dress is gracefully billowing outwards to her left, as if caught by a gentle breeze, emphasizing its light and ethereal quality. The overall pose suggests a moment of gentle movement, perhaps a turn or a stroll.
The setting is a softly blurred outdoor garden or pathway, with indistinct trees and delicate, light-colored blossoms in the background, creating a dreamy, bokeh effect. Soft, romantic lighting (either backlight or soft side light) highlights her hair and the contours of her face, casting a subtle glow.  with a soft, slightly vintage or filmic quality, focusing on delicate textures and ethereal beauty.
Key focus: elegant posture, subtle and soft back arch, graceful body twist, relaxed and softly extended right hand, flowing dress, serene expression, soft lighting, depth of field.
