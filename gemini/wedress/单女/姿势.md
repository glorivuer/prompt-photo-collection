Create an ultra-realistic full-body photograph of a beautiful Asian woman. 
Use the attached reference image ONLY for her facial appearance: same facial proportions, eye shape, soft expression, glowing smooth skin, and delicate beauty. Do NOT copy her pose.

POSE (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT — follow exactly):
• The model is sitting on the floor in an asymmetrical kneeling pose.
• Her inner leg (the leg closest to the camera) supports her weight by sitting directly on her heel.– She must actually SIT on her heel (not on the floor).
 – The heel carries her body weight.
 – The toes of the inner foot press lightly into the floor for balance.
• Her front leg is bent forward with the shin angled on the floor.
 – The knee is raised at a medium height (not too high, not too low).
 – This allows her upper body to lean back slightly, creating an elegant curve.

BODY POSITION:
• Her torso is tall, straight, elegant, slightly leaning back.• Waist gently arched to enhance feminine curves.
• Subtle twist of her upper body toward the camera.

ARMS & HANDS:
• Right arm extends forward naturally, resting lightly on the raised knee.
• Left arm rests gracefully beside her body or gently on her thigh.
• Fingers are relaxed, soft, feminine.

HEAD & EXPRESSION:
• Head tilted slightly toward her raised knee.
• Soft gaze looking at the camera—gentle, calm, elegant, slightly sensual.
• Lips softly closed or slightly pressed, no http://smiling.HAIR:
• Long wavy hair, loose and natural, falling over both shoulders, with more volume toward the front on the right side.
• Hair frames the face, adding softness.

LEGS & FEET:
• Inner leg: kneeling with the model sitting on her heel, toes pressed to the floor.
• Outer/front leg: positioned forward, knee raised, forming a beautiful curve.
• High-heel sandals with luxurious integrated wrap-around straps:
 – Straps must be part of the shoes, not separate accessories.– Thin, elegant straps decorated with diamond-like accents.
 – The straps spiral upward from the shoe base around the ankle and calf in a continuous, seamless design.

OUTFIT (FULL DETAILED DESCRIPTION):
• A luxurious, silky satin top with a smooth, glossy surface and elegant embroidery patterns in blue and gold.
• The fabric must look premium, soft, flowing, and reflective.
• A black sheer embroidered skirt with gold floral details drapes naturally around her legs.• The skirt’s semi-transparent texture reveals the shape of her thighs subtly and tastefully.

LIGHTING:
• Warm, soft, late-afternoon directional light from the side, creating gentle highlights on her face, arms, and legs.
• Skin should appear glowing, radiant, and smooth.
• Strong, crisp focus on her face and eyes.

CAMERA STYLE:
• Slightly low-angle camera to elongate her legs and enhance the elegant pose.
• Full-body framing, but close enough to show finedetail on clothing, skin, and accessories.
• Shallow depth of field with softly blurred warm background.

BACKGROUND:
• Minimal, warm-toned interior environment.
• Background must be softly blurred (bokeh effect) to emphasize the model.

OVERALL MOOD:
• Elegant, feminine, luxurious, soft, graceful, with a refined sexy tone.
• Must look like a high-end fashion editorial photograph.Image Ratio 3:4
