cinematic high-angle shot of a newly married couple in a classic wooden Riva boat on dark, rippling water. 
The handsome groom with dark hair, in a white shirt and black trousers, is lovingly kissing the cheek of the beautiful bride. 
The bride[image1 ,face 100% match, with fair skin, delicate features, and a gentle, serene expression], with her dark hair in an updo, eyes closed and a serene smile, is wearing a chic minimalist satin slip wedding dress, elegant long white gloves, and a pearl necklace. She holds a bouquet of white flowers. The scene is intimate and romantic, with soft, natural lighting, creating a moody and timeless atmosphere. 
The composition uses the boat to frame the couple, shot on 35mm film, hyper-realistic. --ar 2:3
