Create an ultra-realistic portrait of the uploaded person (Do not change facial features of the person from the uploaded photo. Keep face of person 100% accurate from the reference image)  lying peacefully on a meadow filled with small wildflowers of various colors — soft pink, yellow, lavender, orange, and white. The person’s head rests gently on the grass, with strands of hair naturally spread around and a few delicate flowers caught in it. Capture a relaxed, dreamy expression with eyes closed and a faint, calm smile. The sunlight should filter softly through nearby leaves, casting light shadows and warm highlights across the face and shoulders.
Use a shallow depth of field so that the background fades into a soft blur, emphasizing the face and nearby flowers in crisp detail. The lighting should be natural and golden, evoking late afternoon or early evening sunlight. Add a gentle bokeh effect on some out-of-focus flowers near the camera to enhance the dreamy atmosphere.
The person wears a light floral dress that matches the tones of the meadow — cream or pastel colors with tiny flower prints. The skin tone should appear naturally warm with light freckles visible, and the hair texture should be soft, slightly wavy, with sunlight reflecting off strands.
Keep the overall color palette warm and earthy — greens, soft browns, and floral hues — with a cinematic balance between light and shadow. The mood should feel peaceful, natural, and nostalgic, as if capturing a quiet moment of connection with nature.
