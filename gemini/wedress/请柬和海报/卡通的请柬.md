Prompt 👇🏻

3D Chibi (choose the style.
Describe her face, hair, body, and clothing)
She appears in the foreground and in color, standing out with precision and clarity against a completely black-and-white comic book background, drawn with thick lines, high contrast, and a high level of detail.
Around her, the comic book panels are arranged dynamically and engagingly, depicting her in distinct scenes with touches of humor and grace: smiling, running, falling, slipping on a banana peel, surprised, nervous, scared, creating a playful and cinematic visual narrative.
Without text on the panels, only action and expressive emotion.
She appears to emerge or remain frozen between the panels, perfectly fusing photographic realism with the illustrated aesthetic of the comic book.
