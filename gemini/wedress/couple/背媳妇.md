Create a candid street photography–style photo with a gritty urban snapshot feel and a retro film aesthetic. Add slight haze and bloom, a warm yellow-green color cast, low contrast, and a strong analog film grain texture. The image should feel like it was shot on a compact digital camera or film simulation.

Camera characteristics: wide-angle lens look (24–28mm), aperture f/2.8, shutter speed 1/100s, high ISO (1600–3200), tungsten white balance with a warm bias. The final image should have slightly soft edges, clearly visible grain, high noise, and subtle motion blur.

Framing is a medium shot from a slightly low and close angle, with a subtly tilted composition. Both subjects are centered in the frame, standing on the side of a city street at night. Lighting relies on ambient streetlights mixed with a harsh on-camera flash, creating strong flash highlights on the subjects while the background remains dark and soft. Shadows fall behind the subjects and blend into the nighttime street.

Environment: a winter night street in Japan with tiled building walls, parked cars, distant traffic, glowing shop signs, neon signage, and reflections forming soft bokeh. The atmosphere feels grungy, playful, slightly chaotic, and nostalgic—classic nighttime street energy.

Subject 1 (female):
Use the face from Reference Image 1 (face only, 100% identical, do not alter facial features). Young woman with fair skin catching strong flash highlights. She has a cheerful smile with a mischievous, playful expression. She wears a white winter jacket with a fur collar and black winter gloves. Her pose shows her hugging the waist of Subject 2 while smiling softly, captured in a candid, spontaneous moment.

Subject 2 (male):
Use the face from Reference Image 2 (face only, 100% identical, do not alter facial features). Young man with fair skin and visible flash highlights. He has a cheerful, natural soft smile. He wears a black winter jacket and black gloves. One hand gently hugs Subject 1 around the neck or shoulder, while the other hand rests inside his jacket pocket. His posture feels relaxed and affectionate.

Background remains darker than the subjects, with washed-out yellow highlights from streetlights, glowing signage bokeh, and soft focus depth. Overall mood is fun, candid, spontaneous, and nostalgic, with a raw film-like look and imperfect street photography charm.
