Photorealistic black and white 4K HD photograph, contemporary editorial style, of a couple lying on the studio floor against a neutral gray background. 
Both look directly at the camera with a calm expression and emotional connection. 
The soft lighting highlights the natural textures of their skin and the harmony of their pose.

WOMAN: LONG, WAVY, LOOSE HAIR FALLING NATURALLY OVER HER SHOULDERS. 
EXPRESSIVE GREEN EYES, SOFT FRECKLES ON HER NOSE, DEFINED LIPS, AND MEDIUM SKIN WITH A NATURAL FINISH. 
SHE IS WEARING A WHITE, SLEEVELESS, TIGHT-FITTED BLOUSE AND GRAY COTTON SWEATPANTS. SHE IS LEANING AGAINST THE MAN'S CHEST, RESTING HER FACE SERENELY AND LOOKING AT THE CAMERA WITH AN INTIMATE AND CALM EXPRESSION.

MAN: THICK, DEFINED EYEBROWS. EYES WITH A SERENE YET INTENSE EXPRESSION. 
STRAIGHT NOSE, MEDIUM-LENGTH LIPS, AND A SHORT, WELL-GROOMED BEARD WITH GRAYISH HINTS THAT HIGHLIGHT HIS FIRM JAW AND DEFINED CHIN. 
WARM, MEDIUM-TONE SKIN WITH A REALISTIC TEXTURE. HE WEARS A TIGHT WHITE T-SHIRT AND GRAY SWEATPANTS, SHOWING OFF HIS DEFINED ARMS.

He is leaning on one arm while supporting the woman with the other, also looking at the camera with a protective expression.

COMPOSITION AND ATMOSPHERE: SOFT AND SIMPLE GRAY BACKGROUND. NO DISTRACTING ELEMENTS.
DIFFUSE STUDIO LIGHTING WITH A SIDE LIGHT (45Â° TO THE LEFT) AND A WHITE REFLECTOR TO SOFTEN THE SHADOWS. 
CENTRAL FOCUS ON THE FACES, SHALLOW DEPTH OF FIELD TO ISOLATE THE COUPLE FROM THE BACKGROUND. NATURAL TEXTURES OF COTTON, LEATHER AND SOFT SHADOWS ON THE FLOOR
