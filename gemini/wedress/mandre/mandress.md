A cinematic portrait in the style of James Bond promotional photography. The subject stands facing the camera, wearing a sharp black tuxedo with a white dress shirt and a black bow tie. His expression is calm but intense, exuding quiet confidence and sophistication. One hand is raised to the bow tie, as if adjusting it - a signature gesture symbolizing composure and elegance.

The lighting is dramatic and minimalist: a single focused key light from the left side (Rembrandt-style lighting) softly illuminates half of the face and upper body, while the rest fades into deep shadow against a pure black background. This contrast creates a mysterious and refined cinematic mood.

The composition is centered and symmetrical, emphasizing the subject’s posture and control. The textures of the tuxedo fabric, the subtle gleam on the watch, and the crisp lines of the shirt are rendered with meticulous detail.

Captured as if with a cinema-grade camera (ARRI Alexa Mini LF or Sony Venice 2) paired with a 85mm f/1.4 lens, producing shallow depth of field, sharp detail, and rich tonal contrast. The overall aesthetic should feel luxurious, timeless, and filmic, reminiscent of a modern Bond poster.


拍摄一张照片。使用附件中的模特照片作为面部参考和体貌特征。

这幅詹姆斯·邦德电影宣传照风格的电影肖像照。拍摄对象面向镜头站立，身着利落的黑色燕尾服，搭配白色衬衫和黑色领结。他的表情平静而专注，散发着沉稳的自信和成熟稳重。一只手举到领结处，仿佛在调整领结——这一标志性动作象征着沉稳与优雅。

光线极简而富有戏剧性：左侧一束聚焦的主光（伦勃朗式布光）柔和地照亮了拍摄对象的半张脸和上半身，其余部分则在纯黑背景下逐渐消失在阴影中。这种对比营造出一种神秘而精致的电影氛围。

构图居中对称，突出了拍摄对象的姿态和掌控力。燕尾服面料的纹理、手表上微妙的光泽以及衬衫的清晰线条都呈现出细致入微的细节。

如同使用电影级相机（ARRI Alexa Mini LF 或 Sony Venice 2）搭配 85mm f/1.4 镜头拍摄，呈现浅景深、清晰锐利的细节和丰富的色调对比。整体美感营造出奢华、隽永、充满电影感的氛围，令人联想起现代邦德海报。

A cinematic waist-up portrait of a man standing in a narrow cobblestone street at dusk. He is wearing a dark three-piece suit with a vest and jacket. His tie is loosely styled, slightly undone in a model-like way, emphasizing a fashionable, relaxed appearance rather than a formal businessman look. His hands are casually in his pockets, giving a confident but laid-back posture. The background is softly blurred, with warm glowing street lamps creating a moody atmosphere.

The scene is illuminated with soft natural ambient light, enhanced by subtle golden backlighting from the lamps. A gentle key light highlights the contours of the suit, while fill light ensures balanced exposure on the subject. Shadows are soft but pronounced enough to create depth and drama.

Captured with a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV and an 85mm f/1.4 lens. Aperture is wide open at f/1.4 for shallow depth of field, isolating the subject from the background with creamy bokeh. Shutter speed around 1/200s and ISO 400 to balance low-light conditions. The color grading is cinematic, with muted tones and slight teal-orange contrast for a dramatic yet timeless mood.
