Illustration Processing
The background is removed and the characters are transformed into cosplayers. (The characters are recreated from illustration data to create photorealistic cosplayers with detailed facial expressions and realistic clothing. *Gender and clothing are faithful to the illustration, without excessive deformation.)

Theme / Overview
- Place the cosplayer in the center of the screen.
- Photorealistic, detailed, and luxurious depiction.
- Paris Fashion Week-style fashion show stage.
- Glamorous lighting and a luxurious runway.
- Cosplayers take turns walking down the runway, maintaining a certain distance between each other, appealing to the audience.

Characters / Cosplayers
- Walking in a vertical line, one at a time, down a narrow path
- Two or three people are positioned from the center to the back of the screen, keeping a sufficient distance between them
- Handsome faces and confident expressions
- Walking is standard on the runway, with the next model preparing in the background
- Models returning and those heading in do not pass each other, but are staged with a time lag

Clothing / Costume Design Examples
- Wearing character costumes
- Small items and accessories with character motifs
- High-end finishes inspired by luxury brand shows

Location / Background

- A well-balanced, realistic scene, without any unnatural uniformity.

- Character visuals are projected onto a large LED panel behind the stage.

- The lighting is colorful and vibrant, with spotlights highlighting the cosplayers.

Camera / Angle
- Point of View (POV) from the center of the runway.
- Filmed to capture the entire runway through the audience.
- Depth is emphasized, creating a natural sense of distance between the models and the runway.
