A high-resolution 3D digital render in professional product photography quality of a cute Q-version designer toy movie poster for "Castle in the Sky". 
The center features collectible toy figurines of Pazu and Sheeta standing on a detailed miniature floating island diorama made of stone blocks, heavily overgrown with soft flocked moss, tiny miniature trees, and ancient ruins. A tiny, weathered plush robot soldier figure is half-buried in the moss near them. Pazu is a Q-version figure wearing his mining vest, goggles pushed up on a soft flocked texture cap, holding a small, glowing lantern. Sheeta, next to him, wears a dress with a soft flocked skirt and her glowing blue levitation stone pendant; her long braid is made of soft plush material. Dramatic sunbeams with dappled light filter through surrounding soft clouds and the scene. At the top center, stylized cute decorative serif typography reads "天空之城" in large Chinese characters, with "Castle in the Sky" in smaller English directly below it, integrated with small cloud and wing motifs. At the bottom center, placed directly against the soft, blurred cloudy background, clean, simple, elegant white handwritten style text reads exactly: "云海彼端的梦想，是永不坠落的希望。". There are no decorative lines, scrolls, or ornaments surrounding this bottom text line.
The overall atmosphere is warm, calm, healing, and dreamlike with a very shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the toys.
