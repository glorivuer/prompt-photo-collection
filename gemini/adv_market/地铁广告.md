Create a movie poster using the original image. The genre of the movie will be determined based on the atmosphere of the original image.
Regardless of whether the original image is anime or live-action, the style and character design of the original image will be maintained as perfectly as possible. However, poses and expressions may be changed to match the poster design. Other people and objects may also be added at this time.
The final generated image will be photorealistic. This does not apply to the poster design, as it will be based on the original image.
The scenery of the underground passage of a Japanese station where the poster is posted will be recreated in a realistic image. People passing through the underground passage will be added.
The reflection of the poster is angled to make it look more realistic.

A scene from a Japanese news program. Hyper-photorealistic rendering.
A male announcer in a realistic suit and a female commentator in a blouse and skirt.
There is a large desk, and the monitor behind it shows a young man being interviewed on a street corner.
A small figurine based on the character from the original image is placed on the desk. The figurine's design must maintain the character design and style from the original image as much as possible. The figurine must not be a 2D representation. It must be designed to have a three-dimensional feel.
The young man being interviewed is holding a large number of goods, including boxes of figurines and rolled-up posters. All of the goods are based on the characters from the original image.
The T-shirt the young man is wearing has a character printed on it that perfectly reproduces the design and style of the original image. The young man's face is blurred.
