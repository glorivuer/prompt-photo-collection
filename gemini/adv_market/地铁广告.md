Create a movie poster using the original image. The genre of the movie will be determined based on the atmosphere of the original image.
Regardless of whether the original image is anime or live-action, the style and character design of the original image will be maintained as perfectly as possible. However, poses and expressions may be changed to match the poster design. Other people and objects may also be added at this time.
The final generated image will be photorealistic. This does not apply to the poster design, as it will be based on the original image.
The scenery of the underground passage of a Japanese station where the poster is posted will be recreated in a realistic image. People passing through the underground passage will be added.
The reflection of the poster is angled to make it look more realistic.
