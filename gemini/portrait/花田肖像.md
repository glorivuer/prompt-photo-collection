A candid portrait of a woman slightly leaning back against the beige wall with the flowering vines, covered both leg, one leg slightly forward. Her arms rest casually by her side, one hand touching the wall, the other brushing her hair. Her expression is relaxed and natural, giving an effortless vibe.

A cinematic ultra-realistic portrait of a young woman standing in a cotton flower field during golden hour, bathed in warm afternoon sunlight.
She stands surrounded by tall cotton plants — the plants reach up to shoulder height, forming a soft, natural enclosure around her.

The cotton flowers are plump, fluffy white clusters sitting atop slender reddish-brown stems, densely packed throughout the frame.
The field is filled with these flowers in every direction, stretching toward the horizon — the subject appears “immersed” in the field, with blooms in both the foreground and background, creating depth and intimacy.

She has medium-length wavy light brown hair, softly tousled by the wind, and a calm, introspective gaze directed slightly over her shoulder at the camera.
Her skin glows naturally under the warm sunlight, with realistic soft shadows emphasizing her jawline and cheekbones.

She wears a thick knitted sweater in pastel multicolor yarn — pink, beige, sky blue, and soft yellow — with a beige ribbed collar. The knitted texture appears tactile and richly detailed, with visible yarn weave and soft fiber fuzz.

The lighting is golden and directional, illuminating the cotton fibers and hair highlights while leaving gentle shadows on one side of her face.
The sky is open and softly dramatic — blue-gray clouds touched by orange and peach tones of sunset light.

Composition: medium portrait framed from chest upward, low camera angle slightly tilted upward to emphasize the surrounding height of the cotton plants. The subject is centered, turned ¾ toward the camera, maintaining strong visual focus on her expression.

Lens and tone: cinematic 50mm shallow depth of field (f/1.8 look), creamy bokeh in the foreground flowers, warm analog film color palette with gentle contrast and realistic grain.

The overall atmosphere is dreamlike, poetic, and serene, blending the calmness of nature with soft emotional realism.
