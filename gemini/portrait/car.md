A photo-realistic 8K full-body portrait features a woman leaning with her back against a sleek Harley-Davidson motorcycle, exuding confidence and poise. Her arms are crossed casually, and she gazes directly at the camera with a calm, self-assured expression. 
She wears a fitted black leather jacket, khaki jeans that complement her style, and black cowboy-style boots that add a touch of rugged elegance. Her stance is relaxed yet commanding, perfectly blending strength and sophistication. 
Next to her, on a clean, modern wall, a bold black-and-white stylized vector portrait mirrors her pose. 
The vector art uses sharp, geometric lines and minimalist shapes to create a modern, artistic echo of her arms-crossed stance, emphasizing a premium, 
contemporary aesthetic. Below the graphic, bold, clean text reads “Shreya Yadav” in large, striking letters, with “ 𝕏 - ShreyaYadav___” in smaller, 
sleek font underneath, maintaining a professional branding vibe.

一幅逼真的 8K 全身肖像画展现了一位女性背靠在一辆时尚的哈雷戴维森摩托车上，散发着自信与沉稳。她随意地交叉双臂，目光直视镜头，表情平静而自信。
她身着合身的黑色皮夹克，搭配与她风格相得益彰的卡其色牛仔裤，脚踩黑色牛仔靴，更添一丝粗犷优雅。她的姿态轻松随意，却又不失威严，完美地融合了力量与精致。
在她旁边，一面简洁现代的墙壁上，一幅大胆的黑白风格矢量肖像画展现了她的姿态。
这幅矢量艺术作品运用锐利的几何线条和简约的造型，以现代艺术的风格呼应她双臂交叉的姿势，彰显出高端的当代美学。
图形下方，醒目的粗体清晰文字“Shreya Yadav”字样醒目，下方较小、流畅的字体“𝕏 - ShreyaYadav___”保持了专业的品牌氛围。
