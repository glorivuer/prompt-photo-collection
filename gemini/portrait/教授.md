Use the uploaded reference photo for exact face and hairstyle. Create a hyper-realistic medium shot of the subject standing confidently at a wooden podium in a classic, grand university lecture hall (reminiscent of Harvard's Sanders Theatre). She is mid-sentence, gesturing with one hand, her gaze direct and authoritative towards a large, unseen audience.
She is wearing a sophisticated charcoal grey tailored suit, a crisp light blue dress shirt, a subtly patterned silk tie or scarf, and sleek titanium-frame professional glasses. Her face is sharply lit by bright, directional stage lighting, emphasizing her focused and intelligent expression. The background shows the warm wood paneling, tiered seating, and a hint of intricate architectural details, 
all slightly out of focus. Cinematic, intellectual, and commanding. Frame the shot from the chest up.
