Core Intent: Create a photorealistic candid street-fashion portrait with extreme shallow depth of field where a single woman is sharply in focus in the mid-ground, surrounded by a moving crowd rendered as soft blur/bokeh. Preserve the exact framing, subject placement, color grade, and atmosphere.

1) Composition & Framing (LOCK)

•Aspect: 4:5 vertical.

•Camera height: chest-to-eye level (slightly above the subject’s shoulder line).

•Framing: mid-ground subject centered slightly left-of-center, from upper chest to top of head clearly visible; shoulders included; background heavily blurred.

•Foreground: two large blurred human shapes frame the subject:

•Left foreground: blurred middle-aged man occupying left third, grey/blue jacket, face out of focus.

•Right foreground: blurred person occupying right-lower quadrant (dark hair), also out of focus.

•Mid-right: blurred older bald man head/shoulder visible behind subject’s right shoulder.

•Background: dense city street with yellow taxi/cab shapes and warm orange bokeh lights; tall urban forms dissolve into creamy blur.

2) Subject (Primary)

•Person: young adult woman, fair/light skin, subtle freckles, natural editorial beauty.

•Hair: medium brown, messy low updo/bun with loose wisps; slightly damp/urban texture; flyaways framing face.

•Expression: calm, slightly serious/curious; lips relaxed; eyes looking directly toward camera with a soft, neutral intensity.

•Pose: body facing right (3/4 profile), head turned back over left shoulder to look at camera.

3) Wardrobe & Accessories (Exact Feel)

•Outerwear: beige/tan trench coat (matte cotton), collar open, classic lapels, slightly rumpled city-wear texture.

•Bag: small shoulder bag with thin gold chain strap on her right shoulder; strap catches a bit of light; bag itself mostly hidden.

•Jewelry: small earring visible (subtle, warm tone).

4) Environment (Street Mood)

•Busy metropolitan sidewalk/street scene, crowd density high.

•Background palette: teal/green-grey city haze + yellow cab + warm orange bokeh lights.

•No readable signage, no sharp background details—everything behind subject remains creamy blur.

5) Lighting (LOCK)

•Natural daylight, overcast-to-soft sun (diffused), no harsh shadows.

•Subject face evenly lit with gentle highlights on cheekbones and nose; cinematic soft contrast.

6) Camera & Optics (CRITICAL)

•Look: telephoto candid portrait with strong compression.

•Lens: 85mm–135mm range, wide open (f/1.4–f/2.0).

•Focus: tack-sharp on subject’s eyes and eyelashes; foreground and background strongly out of focus.

•Depth: creamy bokeh, smooth falloff, mild cat-eye bokeh at edges.

•Shutter/feel: background crowd appears naturally blurred from DOF; slight motion blur suggested in foreground figures.

7) Color Science / Grade (LOCK)

•Cinematic teal/green wash in shadows and background.

•Warm highlights (skin tones natural, slightly warm).

•Yellow taxi pops softly; orange bokeh lights glow.

•Fine film grain, subtle halation on bright bokeh points, gentle vignette.

8) Texture & Realism

•Natural skin texture (pores, freckles visible).

•Hair flyaways crisp near face.

•Trench fabric weave visible on in-focus areas.

•Editorial street-photo realism, not stylized/illustrated.
