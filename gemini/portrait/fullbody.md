Full-length editorial photograph of a young woman[image1 ,with 100% facial accuracy, with fair skin, delicate features, long dark brown hair,and a gentle, slightly smile expression] standing against a clean wall. She wears a meticulously tailored navy blue Gucci suit, perfectly fitted, a crisp white Hermès blouse, polished brown Gucci loafers with fine socks, and a subtle luxury wristwatch (Rolex or Omega). A Hermès women’s leather bag rests at her side, and a sleek pocket square provides a refined detail. Her pose is relaxed yet commanding, with both hands in her suit pockets, one leg casually crossed over the other, radiating effortless confidence. The lighting is bright, crisp, and editorial, with flattering highlights and deep shadows that enhance the depth and texture of the luxury fabrics. On the wall beside her, there is a bold, black-and-white stylized vector portrait of the same woman, crafted with geometric lines and minimalist patterns, exuding an art-gallery edge. Beneath the portrait, in clean modern typography, the text reads: Genai  . High-fashion photography, 8k, ultra-detailed.
