使用提示：一段剪纸拼贴风格的视频。一位女士向前走去。一把剪刀的图案从左侧向前移动，逐渐切入画面。随后，整个屏幕变成一幅剪纸拼贴画，一道宽阔的、边缘粗糙的白色斜线横贯在她米色针织连衣裙的腰部。


SUBJECT: Ultra photorealistic, full-body portrait of a person standing with their back mostly to the camera (rear view), looking back over the shoulder at the camera. The person is wearing a top and a pair of bottoms (pants, shorts, or a skirt).
Conceptual Trick Photography / Visual Effect (Mousatsu - 妄撮): The garment worn on the lower body (the bottoms) must be rendered as if it's a single, flat piece of paper printed with the original garment's pattern, pasted onto the body. This printed paper is horizontally and sharply torn in a single, continuous line located across the lower back, specifically in a position that reveals a strip of her skin. The tear must span from the left edge to the right edge of the frame. The tear line, while jagged, should maintain a predominantly straight overall appearance. This tear cuts through the garment, exposing a clear strip of the bare skin beneath the printed paper, as if a section of the paper has been removed. The cross-section of the torn paper must be visibly thin and clearly textured, with the edges slightly peeled or curled, naturally blending the transition between the paper and the exposed skin.

Aesthetic: Ultra photorealistic, hyperdetailed, natural soft studio lighting, high resolution.

主题：超写实全身肖像，人物背对镜头站立（后视图），回头看向镜头。人物身着上衣和下装（裤子、短裤或裙子）。

概念错觉摄影/视觉效果（妄摄）：下身穿着的衣物（裤子）必须呈现为一张印有衣物图案的单张平整纸张，并粘贴在人物身上。这张纸张在人物的下背部被水平撕裂，撕裂处需露出部分皮肤。撕裂线必须从画面左侧延伸至右侧边缘。撕裂线虽然呈锯齿状，但整体上应保持笔直。撕裂线穿透衣物，露出纸张下方的皮肤，如同纸张的一部分被撕掉一般。撕纸的横截面必须明显很薄，纹理清晰，边缘略微翘起或卷曲，自然地过渡纸张与裸露的皮肤。

美学：超逼真、细节丰富、自然柔和的影棚灯光、高分辨率。
