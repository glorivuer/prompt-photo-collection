Ultra-realistic cinematic travel photo, 8K. Face unchanged from reference. A women, wears light gold slip leans out from the door of a moving green Chinese train, 
she calmly. She holds the train handle with his left hand, body half slightly extended outside. The train crosses a curved stone arch bridge over a river,
surrounded by lush green mountains. Warm golden-hour light, depth of field, adventurous travel mood.
